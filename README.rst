`Argon2 <https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2>`_ won the `Password Hashing Competition <https://password-hashing.net/>`_ and *argon2-cffi* is the simplest way to use it in Python and PyPy:

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from argon2 import PasswordHasher
  >>> ph = PasswordHasher()
  >>> hash = ph.hash("s3kr3tp4ssw0rd")
  >>> hash  # doctest: +SKIP
  '$argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$tSm+JOWigOgPZx/g44K5fQ$WDyus6py50bVFIPkjA28lQ'
  >>> ph.verify(hash, "s3kr3tp4ssw0rd")
  True
  >>> ph.check_needs_rehash(hash)
  False
  >>> ph.verify(hash, "t0t411ywr0ng")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  argon2.exceptions.VerifyMismatchError: The password does not match the supplied hash


*argon2-cffi*'s documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.io/>`_, the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi>`_.
Itâ€™s rigorously tested on Python 2.7, 3.5+, and PyPy.

It implements *Argon2* version 1.3, as described in
`Argon2: the memory-hard function for password hashing and other applications <https://www.cryptolux.org/images/0/0d/Argon2.pdf>`_.
